[{"content":"Concert Booking System: Simplifying Ticket Reservations üéüÔ∏è Project Overview The Concert Booking System is a Java-based web service designed to simplify ticket reservations for concerts. Built with scalability and performance in mind, this project showcases my backend development skills, focusing on efficiency and reliability in high-demand scenarios such as concert ticket sales.\nFeatures Concert and Performer Information: Users can browse and explore details about concerts, performers, and schedules without logging in. Interactive Seat Map: Visualize seat availability in real-time and reserve seats directly through the interface. Secure Authentication: Users can log in with token-based authentication to view and manage their bookings securely. Double-Booking Prevention: Ensures only one user can book a specific seat for a given concert at a time. Notifications for Sell-Out Events: Users can subscribe to updates for concerts nearing full booking capacity. Planned Features The current version of the Concert Booking System is fully functional, but I plan to enhance it with the following features:\nDynamic Ticket Pricing: Support for unique ticket prices for each concert. Multi-Venue Support: Manage events across multiple venues with distinct layouts. Hold Reservations: Allow users to temporarily reserve seats during the checkout process to avoid losing selections.
